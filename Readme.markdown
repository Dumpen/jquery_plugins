## EditInPlace
A jQuery plugin that allows you to simply turn something into a text box that calls a callback with the value after the user hits Tab or Enter.
## FuzzyString
QuickSilver-like string matching, but on super steroids! So good that I can just think of an option and let my fingers hit the keyboard, and it STILL matches what I was thinking of as the best match.
## QuickSelect
Type in an input box, and a list of matching options shows below. Use your arrow keys to select one of them and it will fill in the rest of the field for you. Lots of options, you can do just about whatever you want with this one.
