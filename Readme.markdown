## EditInPlace
Allows you to simply turn an element into a text box that disappears and calls a callback with the value after the user hits Tab or Enter.
## FuzzyString
QuickSilver-like string matching, but on super steroids! So good that I can just think of an option and let my fingers hit the keyboard, and it STILL matches what I was thinking of as the best match.

Here's how it works: [http://bit.ly/1xBafm](http://bit.ly/1xBafm)
## Input Placeholder
Keeps helper text in an input box as long as it's not focused and doesn't have some other value in it.
## QuickSelect
Type in an input box, and a list of matching options shows below. Use your arrow keys to select one of them and it will fill in the rest of the field for you. Lots of options, you can do just about whatever you want with this one.
## Range Selector
This UI widget allows you to select a range of items using the mouse. Good for things like the alphabet or numbers where you want to select a range. Simply calls a callback whenever a new range has been selected.
